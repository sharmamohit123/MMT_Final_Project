This is a night to remember
It's burning hot in December
You make me surrender
I follow you out on the floor
Rock with me now to the tempo
Ahora es el momento
My body is your temple
Ma muy caliente, amor

Una vida ganaste en la ruleta
Con tu movimiento gáname
Bailando, gozando, tu cuerpo, el flamenco, olé
Una vida ganaste en la ruleta
Con tu movimiento
Ves ves ves, otra vez vez vez vez

Now it only takes two to tango
And all you're talking my lingo
You know I'm no angel
And I know you're a dirty boy
Snack to drinks of this table
Dance with me in the middle
Dame un beso
And I'll give you a thousand more

Una vida ganaste en la ruleta

Uh huh, hey ma, escúchale
Y cuando empiezas a moverte me tienes a tus pies
Hasta mi abrigo me lo pongo al revés
Escucha mami, me tiene bien harto
Alguien me dijo que te gustan los altos
Siempre me provocas y te sale muy bien
Tú sabes que no me olvidé la noche de ayer (oye, mami)
En la que tú me maltrataste
Ya sé, la clave para conquistarte
