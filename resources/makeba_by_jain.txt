"Ooohe" Makeba, Makeba ma qué bella,
can I get a "Oohe" Makeba, makes my body dance for you,
[x4]

I want to hear your breath just next to my soul,
I want to feel oppress without any rest,
I want to see you sing, I want to see you fight,
cause you are the real beauty of human right,

"Ooohe" Makeba, Makeba ma qué bella,
can I get a "Oohe" Makeba, makes my body dance for you,
[x2]

Nobody can beat the Mama Africa,
you follow the beat that she's going to give you,
only her smile can all make it go,
the sufferation of a thousand more.

"Ooohe" Makeba, Makeba ma qué bella,
can I get a "Oohe" Makeba, makes my body dance for you,
[x6]
