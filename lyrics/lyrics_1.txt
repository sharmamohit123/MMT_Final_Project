Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Yeah...
I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hoping you'll find someone else
Cause yeah, we still young there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it off this bed
I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

I'm happy that you're here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos while walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sang me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays went to church, on Mondays watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

I got theâ€”fdcsfdcsfdcsI used to shut my door while my mother screamed in the kitchen
I'd turn the music up, get high and try not to listen to every little fight
'Cause neither one was right

I swore I'd never be like them
But I was just a kid back then

The older I get the more that I see
My parents aren't heroes, they're just like me
'Cause loving is hard, it don't always work
You just try your best not to get hurt
I used to be mad but now I know
Sometimes it's better to let someone go
It just hadn't hit me yet
The older I get

I used to wonder why, why they could never be happy
I used to close my eyes and pray for a whole 'nother family
Where everything was fine, one that felt like mine

I swore I'd never be like them
But I was just a kid back then

The older I get the more that I see
My parents aren't heroes, they're just like me
And loving is hard, it don't always work

Sometimes it's better to let someone go

And in traffic
I didn't feel it
When the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
Were you out drinkin'
Were you in the living room
Chillin' watchin' television
It's been a year now
Think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

I know you know we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending
You'd come over right
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
Right?
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
Right?

I tried to imagine
Your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
That night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house
And didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah it's been a year now
Think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

I know you know we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending
You'd come over right
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
No there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
You'd come over right
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over right

I know you know we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending
You'd come over right
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it

No there wouldn't be a reason why

You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over right

If the world was ending
You'd come over rightfdcsSmall talk, no conversation
That look makes me impatient
I can't tell what you're thinkin'
Please tell me what you're thinkin'
Last night we were more than fine
Just tell me if you changed your mind
If you changed your mind (mi-i-ind)

'Cause I'm all, I'm all in
I'm callin', no answer
But you text me when you feel like,
When it feels right to you
But I'm all, I'm all in
I'm fallin' faster
But if you're looking at me with a
Heart of doubt

Don't kiss me right now
Don't tell me that you need me
Don't show up at my house
All caught up in your feelings
Don't run me round and round
Don't build me up just to let me
Down, just to let me
Down, down, down (eh)
Don't mess with my head
Don't tell me you're falling
With your feet still on the ledge
I'm all out of breath, baby
Don't run me round and round
Don't kiss me, no, don't kiss me
Right now, on your lips just leave it
If you don't mean it

Ah, yeah
You know you got me in the palm of your hand
But I love those hands
Ah, yeah
But you only let me hold you when he can't
Yeah, I don't understand

'Cause I'm all, I'm all in
I'm callin', no answer
But you text me when you feel like,
When it feels right to you

"Hurry home, let's never leave the house"
(But you don't mean it)
"Let's stay in bed while all our friends go out"
(But you don't mean it)
Why you let those words come out your mouth?
(If you don't mean it)
You've been staring at me with a heart of doubt
(Ah-ah)

Don't kiss me right now
Don't tell me that you need me
Don't show up at my house
All caught up in your feelings
Don't run me round and round
