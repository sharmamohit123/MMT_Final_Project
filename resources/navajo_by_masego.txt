I know you see it, girl
This ain't sitting real good in my soul
Everywhere this little girl goes
She pick up another obstacle
She was my heart
I don't know the tribe or the fall
But by default she don't think of me

I thought she was an Indian (Navajo)
She be slangin' thangs like a simian (Now I know)
All my life I wanted me an Indian (There She Go)
Now she's far away
But I had to know

I know you see it, girl
This ain't sitting real good in my soul
Everywhere this little girl goes
She pick up another obstacle
She was my heart
I don't know the tribe or the fall
But by default she don't think of me

I thought she was an Indian (Navajo)
She be slangin' thangs like a simian (Now I know)
All my life I wanted me an Indian (There She Go)
Ooo girl lemme in

In the street
With a wedding ring
And she hit the bar
City babe, are you down to cheat
He looked in her eye
Chivalry is it really dead?
He pulled out a tip? Pay Up
Jumpin' right on him
Thinkin' when's it good to intervene
Then I lost her
Lost her to the world and the girls and impostors
Entertain? I doubt it'll pay and it cost her
I ain't mad at me but it hurts

I thought she was an Indian (Navajo)
Now she only worried bout' the Benjamin's (Grab The Gold)
She Been lurking' in my dreams (There she go)
I swear that eyes on me
