fdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsI'm the next act
Waiting in the wings

I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car

I am all of the days
That you choose to ignore

You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light

I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night

I only stick with you
Because there are no others

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

It's all wrong
It's alright
It's all wrong
It's alrightfdcsfdcsThere's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who stand looking.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,
And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.fdcsShadow, see how far I go
(Step by step I'll keep it up, I won't slow, I gotta go)
Through the embers, through the rows
(Every shadow step I take, I'll make sure that I won't break)
Show them all just what I know
(While the years they come and go, I won't let myself get slow)
'Cause they all just come and go
(Every step that I will take, I'll make sure that I won't break)

Oh, if I fall down, fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
Oh, if I fall down, fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running

And if it hurts don't let it show
(Step by step I'll keep it up, I won't slow, I gotta go)
While the seasons come and go
(Every shadow step I take, I'll make sure that I won't break)
Shadow chiaroscuro
(While the years they come and go, I won't let myself get slow)
When I, when I fall down, fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
Oh, when I fall down, fall down
Won't you know to keep me running

Yeah, I keep on running
Well, I keep on running

Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer, so I'll go on further
Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer, so I'll go on further
Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer, so I'll go on further
Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer, so I'll go on further

Oh, when I fall down, fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
Oh, if I fall down, fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running

Fall down, when I slow down (Keep on running)
Slow down (Keep on running)
Ohh, slow down (Keep on running)
(Keep on running)
(Keep on running)
(Keep on running)
(Keep on running)fdcsFree as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?

Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so...

Free as a bird
Like the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free

Ah...
Ah...
Ah...

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Oooooo

Free...

The mouths are all choking
