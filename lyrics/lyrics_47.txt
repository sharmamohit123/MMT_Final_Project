fdcsWe are spirit
Bound to this flesh
We go around one foot nailed down
We're bound to reach out and beyond
This flesh become Pneuma

We are will and wonder
Bound to recall, remember
(We are born of)
One breath, one word
(We are all)
One spark, sun becoming

Child, wake up
Child, release
The light
Wake up now, child, wake up
Child, release
The light
Wake up now, child

Pneuma
Reach out and beyond
Wake up, remember

One breath, one word

One spark, eyes full of wonderfdcsI, once upon a time
Carried a burden inside
I sung a last goodbye
A broken rhyme I had underlined
There's an ocean of sorrow in you

A sorrow in me

I saw a movement in their eyes
They said I no longer knew the way
I had given up the ghost
A passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

Waiting to fail

Failing again

If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear
You've taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is youfdcsGravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

Oh I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Oh, gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

Oh twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more
That's gonna send me to my knees
Oh twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more
That's gonna send me to my knees

Oh gravity, stay the hell away from me
Oh gravity has taken better men than me (how can that be?)

Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
C'mon keep me where the light is
C'mon keep me where the light is
C'mon keep me where keep me where the light is (oh, oh)fdcsFloating on mist
Crept up the caverns of my brain
Received no warning
From nothing to a life code
Walk with me, you'll never leave
Wait to see your spirit free
Tell me how your heart's in need
As I drown you in the sea
Unwinding snares of distrust
Your wrist in my fast grip
Look me in the eye, I'm clear
This is your time
Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep
From love to death
In a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret
Pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane
Gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes
Is the shade of the night
The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory is nothing but the scars on me
All over now
Forgotten why I needed this
Standing down
Disappear into the obscure
Resting days
Waiting for new disease
Biding time
Locked inside insanity
It always burns within
The downward spiral never ends
When driven into sin
Your salvation's found in a sinner's deed
The devil guides the way
Tells me what to say
Pours himself inside
And snuffs the final light

Deliverance
Thrown back at me

Deliverance
Laughing at mefdcsLong in tooth and soul
Longing for another win
Lurch into the fray
Weapon out and belly in

Warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Bellow aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am

Beating chest and drums
Beating tired bones again
Age-old battle, mine
Weapon out and belly in

Tales told
Of battles won
Of things we've done
Caligula would grin

Beating tired bones
Tripping through, remember when
Once invincible
Now the armor's wearing thin
Heavy shield down

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Relevant

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Cry aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am
Where I am

Warrior
Struggling
To remain
Relevant

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Tears in my eyes, chasing Ponce de León's phantoms
So filled with hope, I can taste mythical fountains
False hope, perhaps, but the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting, feeling time, bearing down

Bearing downfdcs[part 1 - Wilson / part 2 (instrumental) - Barbieri, Edwin, Maitland, Wilson]

You think I deserve this
You said I was stupid
All my thoughts are like coal
But Russia on ice is burning a hole

Can't stop myself drinking
Can't stop being me
If I call will you come and will you save me?

I see the whole thing come down
I burn it to the ground
Well what the hell did you say?
You said you hate me this way
It's just a matter of time

A drop in the ocean
A significant motion
Nothing melts in this cold
But Russia on ice is burning a holefdcsfdcsI got room
In my fumes (Yeah!)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit!)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)

She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone
I see some things that you might fear
"I'm doing a show, I be back soon" (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (No)
Now I got her in my room (Uh)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom
Hope we make it outta here
When I'm with you I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah!)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side

'Case it's fumes (Smoke)
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up!)
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit!)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)

We ain't stressing 'bout the loot
My block made that caserío
This not the Molly this the boot
Ain't no coming back from here
Live the life of La Familia
It's so much gang that I can't see ya
Turn it up till they can't hear (They can't)
Running, running 'round for the thrill
Yeah, dog, dog 'round my real (Damn!)
Raw, raw, I've been pouring to the rim (Drank)
Naw, naw, naw, they not back of the VIP (In the VIP)
Gorgeous, baby keep me hard as steel
Ah, this my life I did not choose
Huh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
Uh, fill my mind up with ideas

'Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up!)
I'm the highest in the room (I'm the highest, it's lit!)
Hope I make it outta here (Outta here)

I'm the highest, you might got the Midas touch
The brightest and my bitch the vibiest
I'm excited, everything I do is exciting, now
Play with giants, little bit too extravagantfdcsAngels on the sideline,
Puzzled and amused.
Why did Father give these humans free will?
Now they're all confused.

Don't these talking monkeys know that
Eden has enough to go around?
Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys,
Where there's one you're bound to divide it.
Right in two.

Angels on the sideline,
Baffled and confused.
Father blessed them all with reason.
And this is what they choose.
And this is what they choose...

Monkey killing monkey killing monkey
Over pieces of the ground.
Silly monkeys give them thumbs,
They forge a blade,
And where there's one
They're bound to divide it,
Right in two.
Right in two.

Monkey killing monkey killing monkey.
Over pieces of the ground.
Silly monkeys give them thumbs.
They make a club.
And beat their brother, down.
How they survive so misguided is a mystery.

Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability to lift an eye to heaven conscious of its fleeting time here.

Gotta divide it all right in two [4x]

Fight 'til they die over wind, over sky
They fight over life, over prayer, over air and light
Over love, over sun, over another
They fight though they die over words polarizing.

Angels on the sideline again.
Benched along with patience and reason.
Angels on the sideline again
Wondering when this tug of war will end.

Gotta divide it all right in two [3x]
Right in two!

Right in two.fdcsThought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh, oh)
Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve
Talk to me, without you I can't breathe

My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distracting my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

Never coming down
I was runnin' away from facing reality
Wastin' all of my time on livin' my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you baby
I'll be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before
I hold you down and not let you go
This time I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still right for you
'Cause this house is not a home

Without my baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before
I hold you down and not let you go
This time I won't break your heart, your heart, no
