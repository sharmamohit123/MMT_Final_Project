The more I try to catch your eye
The less I seem to hesitate
But every time you cross my mind
The words come out in figure 8's

I need to let go of everything
Ooh, it's getting hard to fight the feeling

She's your girl
She's in all your pictures
California girl, I wish I was her
When you're gone
She sleeps in your t-shirts
It hurts, I wish I was her
Ms. California
Ms. California

I love your voice but hate the way
You talk of her consistently
But every time you say her name
It honestly kills me
I need to let go of everything
Ooh, it's getting hard to fight the feeling

She's your girl
She's in all your pictures
California girl, I wish I was her
When you're gone
She sleeps in your t-shirts
It hurts, I wish I was her
Ms. California

And everything's better in California
And everything's better in California

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
