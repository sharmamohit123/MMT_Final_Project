Hot in, so hot in here, so hot in

Come on a little bit of uh uh and a little bit of uh uh
Check a little bit of... just a little bit of...
Just a little bit of... just a little bit of...

[Nelly:]
I was like, good gracious ass is bodacious
Flirtatious, trying to show faces
Looking for the right time to shoot my steam (you know)
Looking for the right time to flash them keys (you know)
I'm leaving, please believe in
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the Four Seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I'm feeding
No deceiving, nothing up my sleeve, no teasing
I need you to get up up on the dance floor
Give that man what he asking for
'Cause I feel like busting loose
And I feel like touching you
And can't nobody stop the juice
So, baby, tell me what's the use?
I said

[2x]
It's getting hot in here (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot,
I wanna take my clothes off

[Nelly:]
(Let it all hang out)
Why you at the bar if you ain't popping the bottles? C'mon
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models
I see you driving, sports car, ain't hitting the throttle
And I'll be down do a hundred, top down and goggles
Got off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweating, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, on at this point
You're with a winner so, baby, you can't lose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
So take it off like you're home alone
You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checking your reflection and telling your best friend,
Like "Girl, I think my butt getting big."

[2x]
It's getting hot in here (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot,
I wanna take my clothes off

(Let it hang all out)
Mix a little bit a ah, ah
With a little bit a ah, ah
(Let it just fall out)
Give a little bit a ah, ah
With a little bit a ah, ah
(Let it hang all out)
With a little bit a ah, ah
And a sprinkle a that ah, ah
(Let it just fall out)
I like it when ya ah, ah
Girl, baby, make it ah, ah

[Nelly:]
Stop pacing, time wasting
I gotta a friend with a pole in the basement (What?)
I'm just kidding like Jason (Oh)
Unless you gon' do it
Extra, extra, eh, spread the news, check it
Nelly took a trip from the Lou' to Neptunes
Came back with something thicker than fitting in Sassons
Say she like to think about cutting in restrooms

[4x]
It's getting hot in here (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot,
I wanna take my clothes off

(Let it hang all out)
Mix a little bit of ah, ah
With a little bit of ah, ah
(Let it just fall out)
Give a little bit of ah, ah
With a little bit of ah, ah

And a sprinkle of that ah, ah
