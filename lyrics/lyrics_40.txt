fdcsfdcsFirst they knockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave 'cause they see me poppin'
Big large pockets, they start flockin'
Here's what I say when they ass keep knockin'

My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers
And never leave your day one's in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My momma said, "Trust no hoe, use a rubber"

I'ma act, one, two, stop the track, bring it back, what it do
See Ricky said "Never let nobody get the one up on you"
If they run up on you, hit 'em with a one, two
Or a bitch slap, leave the cul-de-sac you're brothers gon' have your back regardless
And stick with your day one homies that was here before you started
And fear no man, but the man above your head
Pray before you got to bed, everything my momma said

First they knockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave 'cause they see me poppin'

And your momma ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit
And I been makin' waves way before Nostalgic
That was back in Carol City yeah, when I was just a jit
With the all black faded Dicky with the Raider fit
That was it, we was lit, y'all wasn't even shit yet
We was Three 6, Wu-Tang mixed with Dipset
Ricky used to take me to my first shows ever
Would only drop jewels way before they dropped cheddar

Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh

Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah

I gave her everything
She took my heart and left me lonely
I think broken heart's contagious
I won't fix, I'd rather weep
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture being in love
I love when you're around
But I fucking hate when you leave

Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh

I'm sad, I know, yeahfdcsfdcsToday is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)fdcsSo this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain-check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I amfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcs
