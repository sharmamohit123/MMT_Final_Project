Mmm, yeah...

Stay right there, get away
I need space, I told you yesterday
Slow the pace down
But then I see your face
Can we do that tomorrow? (Can we do that tomorrow?)
'Cause now you're moving in
On my skin
I move back with my lips
It goes against my better judgement
'Cause I, 'cause I want it, yeah

And I'm gonna be clich√© here for a minute
And tell you that I've been hurt before (hurt before)
So I think I'm gonna need another minute
To not hurt no more (no more)

'Cause all I do is jump right into your arms
Every time I see you, I just wrap myself around you
Yeah, jump into something real
Even though I'm cautious, I just like the way it feels
When it's us, baby, when it's us
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love
I jump, oh, I jump

Look at me, being soft
Cut it all, my mind is getting lost
From your touch, I can't afford the cost
Only losing myself to you (losing myself to you)
And I didn't want these feelings, but I brought 'em
But I know that you know exactly when I caught 'em
And I'm trying not to think about it often but, ooh

'Cause all I do is jump right into your arms
Every time I see you, I just wrap myself around you
Yeah, jump into something real
Even though I'm cautious, I just like the way it feels
When it's us, baby, when it's us
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love
I jump, oh, I jump

[Trippie Redd:]
Jump, jump up in his foreign
Used to sleep on couches now the boys really tore
If they sleep on me I tell 'em haters gonna sleep it away, yeah
Fell in love, but it ain't no trust
If it ain't no trust then that girl can't be my love
'posed to put my love above
But instead you gon' sleep it away, yeah
Like a earthquake, yeah I'm dealing with another lil' heartbreak
Man I wish I'd never met you in the first place
And that karma's gonna get you in the worst way
Don't throw your love away
Don't throw your trust away
You always run away
I wish you would fucking stay
But I guess we need another break
