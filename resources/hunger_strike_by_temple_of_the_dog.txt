I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled
Yeah

But it's on the table
The fire's cooking
And they're farming babies
The slaves are all working

Blood is on the table
The mouths are all choking
But I'm goin' hungry, yeah

I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled, mmm mmm

But it's on the table
The fire is cooking
And they're farming babies
The slaves are all working

And it's on the table
Their mouths are all choking
But I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry)

I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry)

Yeah, I don't mind stealing bread
(Mmm, I don't mind)
No, I don't mind stealing bread

I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry, yeah)
