Did I talk way too long when I told you all my feelings that night?
Is it you? Is it me? Did you find somebody better?
Someone who isn't me, 'cause I know that I was never your type
Never really your type

Overthinking's got me drinking
Messing with my head, whoa

Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

But everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart

When you said it was real, guess I really did believe you
Did you fake how you feel when we parked down by the river that night? That night?
That night when we fogged up the windows in your best friend's car
'Cause we couldn't leave the windows down in December
Whoa

Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken

An example of the perfect candidate

You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

I used to look into my father's eyes.
In a happy home
I was a king, I had a golden throne.
Those days are gone,
Now the memory's on the wall.
I hear the songs
From the places where I was born.

Upon a hill across a blue lake,
That's where I had my first heartbreak.
I still remember how it all changed.

My father said,
"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."
Yeah!

"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."
Yeah!

There was a time
I met a girl of a different kind.
We ruled the world,
I thought I'd never lose her out of sight.
We were so young,
I think of her now and then.
I still hear the songs
Reminding me of a friend.

Upon a hill across a blue lake,
That's where I had my first heartbreak.
I still remember how it all changed.

My father said,
"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."
Yeah!

Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh!

See heaven's got a plan for you

"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."

Whoever's listening, if someone cares to listen in
I've been up and down in life, sure, every day's a chance to fight
Forever wrestling, trying to make amends again

But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go
It's hitting me hard but I'm lucky I know

All of my friends
Don't understand
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm blind
Maybe we all get lost sometimes
Sometimes

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)

And every night when I'm alone I put another podcast on
It helps me slip away, keeps me learning everyday
Reading books on meditation fights away the hesitations
Hanging over me, easing the anxiety

But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go

Don't understand
Maybe I'm crazy
Going outta my mind
Maybe we all get lost sometimes

Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

Tell me why
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
Youâ€™ve been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh

Lalalalalalalalalalala
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, I know the sun must set to rise."

Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip
Take all of your savings out
'Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out

Baby come on

Forget what Father Brennan said
We were not born in sin
Leave a note on your bed
Let your mother know you're safe

We'll have driven through the state
We'll have driven through the night

If the sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave
Or will you rail against your dying day

And when we looked outside
Couldn't even see the sky
How do you pay the rent
Is it your parents
Or is it hard work dear
Holding the atmosphere
I don't wanna live like that, yeah

If the sun don't shine on me today
If the subways flood and the bridges break
