Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so...

Cold enough to chill my bones?
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, oh, when we're kissing, yeah
Feel so different, yeah.
Baby, tell me how did you get so...

Cold enough to chill my bones?
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Future:]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space

[Adam Levine:]
Baby, tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones?

And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet
All the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is 'No'

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl

Yeah, no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so
Rude

I hate to do this, you leave no choice
Can't live without her
Love me or hate me we will be both
Standing at that altar
Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die

Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom

When I'm with you I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah!)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side

The brightest and my bitch the vibiest
I'm excited, everything I do is exciting, now
Play with giants, little bit too extravagantfdcsI live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep

I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's all right, hush
Shh

Tape my eyes open to force reality (no, no)
Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
And sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me

I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's all right, hush
Shh

I want to taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a one-way gate to Hell
I want to taste consumption
Breathe faster to waste oxygen
Hear the children sing aloud
It's music 'til the wick burns out, hush

Just wanna be carefree lately, yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets
Count 'em like the four-leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces, yeah
Just tripping on daydreams
Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheepfdcsfdcsfdcs
