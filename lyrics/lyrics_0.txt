fdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsThe night sky once ruled my imagination.
Now I turn the dials with careful calculation.
After a while, I thought I’d never find you.
I convinced myself that I would never find you,
When suddenly I saw you.

At first I thought you were a constellation.
I made a map of your stars, then I had a revelation:
You’re as beautiful as endless,
You’re the universe I’m helpless in.
An astronomer at my best
When I throw away the measurements.

Like a telescope,
I will pull you so close
'til no space lies in between.

And suddenly I see you.
Suddenly I see you.

I was a billion little pieces
'til you pulled me into focus.
Astronomy in reverse,
It was me who was discovered.

(I thought I’d never find you,
When suddenly I saw you.)

Like a telescope,
I will pull you so close,
'til no space lies in between.

Then suddenly I see you.fdcsIt might be impractical
To seek out a new romance
We won't know the actual
If we never take the chance
I'd love to collapse with you 
And ease you against this song
I think we're compatible 
I see that you think I'm wrong

But anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you

Your love makes a fool of you 
You can't seem to understand
Our heart doesn't play by rules
And love has it's own demands
But I'll be there to take care of you 
If ever you should decide
But you don't want to waste your life
In the middle of a lovesick lullaby

Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you

Oh my reddest rose, caldera, set it off
How your fire grows hermosa caldera glistening 
Through your fussed blows careen your caldera set it off
As your body flows the second hand flashes passes
Over your skin like time

Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to youfdcsAh
I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a beanbag
Turn you inside out to lick you like a crisp packet

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

You're the first and last of your kind
(Pull me like an animal out of a hole!)
I wanna be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you
Gonna paw paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woolen jumper
Be your Minpin
And Borrower of handsome trivia

Hey!

Oh, devour me
Ah
Lou Lou, let the cover girls sing
Hey!

Do, do do do, do do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do do, do do
Do, do do do, do do, do do, do do
Do do do, do do

All hand claps
You will clap
(Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room)
I want to be every button you press
And all the baths that surround you
Yes, I'm gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around saw-dusted patios
I'm gonna kiss you like the sun browns you

Hey!

Oh oh oh oh oh devour me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh devour me
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh)
If you really think that you can stomach me

Hey hey!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle

Me llamo Roberto
Y vamos a destruir nuestra casa

[Joba:]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Just wanna hold ya
Never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you waiting for?

[Dom McLennon:]
It feels like I can see the past in your eyes
I know the future has been passing you by
These other niggas, they just passing your time
They don't know how to ride the tidal waves that crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe
Then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean
They boxin' us in but we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want
I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for ya
I'm taking a stand for ya, I care for ya

[Matt Champion:]
What's your motive with me baby
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head
Cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect
Sometimes I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
Cause I know thousand men want ya
Wants the menages
Fucking riding shotgun, slap your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and the sun
85, 90, gon' bust out the gun
Know they sent me from the neck of the woods
Change my name, state so they never could

[Joba:]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Just wanna hold ya
Never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you waiting for?

[Ameer Vann:]
I need a friend (I need a friend)
And you need a home (you need a home)
I love when you come (I love when you come)
I still feel alone
You make it warm in my bed
Butterflies in my head
Sun rise and it set
But you don't love me like you say you do
White lies hold the hidden truth
You keep leaving when I need you most
It's true what they say about love had and love lost
Here you are and now you're gone
I'm left alone in the same bed
I wake up in a cold sweat

[Joba:]
Please don't make me wait long
I just wanna be your main boy, your main, your main one, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody but you, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody but you, mm-mm
I spent the day by my lonesome
Who do you call when there's no one?
No one ever did what you did for me and to me
My bed is cold and indented where you used to sleep
Tell me what you're waiting for, shit
Tell me what I'm here for

Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Just wanna hold ya
Never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you waiting for?fdcsfdcs
