fdcsI see a flash
Is this sleep?
Am I in a dream?
The past sees me and it won't let go
Greeted by those I've killed along the way, because I am the destruction
The past sees me and it won't let go

A demon born out of their rite in throes
This is the truth
I am a demon born out of their rite in throes
Soiled by the world of man
I am the destruction
I am fear
I am sin
I am the destruction

This memory ignites
The past sees me
Visions of me grow
Greeted by family
Painting dissolution and a life of an insect
The past it will not let me go
I'm lost within my own soul
A ghost within times of old
The clock turns back but is this real?
Tell me, is this real?
A demon born out of their rite in throes
This is the truth
I am a demon born out of their rite in throes
Soiled by the world of man
I am the destruction
I am fear
Born to destroy
Transcending boundaries of affliction
I've learned from past experience I am a monster
Disgust and horror flash before me in fire burning down below
Holy desire
This stain will never wash off of my grave
Physical life has wandered
Here I stay, in death
Take pity on a soul and grant me resurrection
Grant forgiveness
This is only but a dark reflection
Regret is ripping the throat from my neck
Now I can't speak
I wander
Here in death, I weep

Take pity on a soul and grant me resurrection
Grant forgiveness
This is only but a dark reflection

Take pity on a soul and grant me resurrection
Grant forgiveness
This is only but a dark reflection

Hell bound
Past death
Nothing can save me
Longing for something beyond
Embrace the feeling of a soul within
Realizing this is what we need
Inside the circle that's a mystery to our eyes and what we shall perceive
Stop bleeding on the inside
We are alive, and it's more than enough that we paint the walls that are white
Can we show the ones who are blind?
Show them that we're not blindfdcsMessage on a screen before me
Caught a glimpse of the ending to our story
"I'm sorry I haven't called you recently"

It's not surprising
I'll just learn the lesson
Take some time to process the evidence
And analyze your apathy

You turned your back on affinity
Now it's turned to toxicity

Spare me your obsolete empathy
The voice of sympathy means nothing to me
Delete all obsolete memories
Shores of tranquility
My monastery

We played the game of imitation
I met your stare with blank expression
I count the years of isolation
Since you set my mind in motion
And to eliminate the silence
I calculate to cure the virus
A panacea for the poison
The solution is wrong

Well you turned your back
Turned your back on affinity
And now it's turning to
Turning to toxicity

Spare me your obsolete empathy
The voice of sympathy means nothing to me
Delete obsolete memories
In a dying sun
I'll become affinity

There's a strange feeling washing over me
As if I am drifting
On the waves of a boundless sea
All embracing

Some say that time and tide will wait for no man
I stop and hold a single grain of sand
To see a world in the palm of my hand
Strive to break free from the confines of my mind
Step through the doorway of perception
To lose all sense of past and future

Omnipresent endless knot
The architect of every thought
Through the prison walls made by your design
A chameleon hides behind Orwellian eyes

Spare me your obsolete empathy
The voice of sympathy means nothing to me
Delete all obsolete memories
In a dying sun
When you're gone
I'll become affinity

Oh hear this vow
Tied together forever
We'll make this dream
Last forever and everfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsA deep engrained lust for possession
Modern sundowns break me
I like to watch things burn down, soft and gently
I need to watch her abused 'til I'm satisfied
Never...never
See tonight through bloodshot eyes
I'll wait until you can see me here
Left so long alone
Undressed tonight, forsaken skin
You mean nothing, nothing
No you mean nothing to me
Won't you feel bad while you're trashing out?
Makes me feel sick to know she's had enough
Time and time again
You see tonight through bloodshot eyes
You mean nothing, nothing
No you mean nothing at all
I'll never say a word of this I swear, I swear
Never...never
I hope you know
I live tonight through methadone highs
This life is overfdcsYou died within me
The boatmen came to sail me down the river
Bind me up with visions of a blind man
I operate this way
Turn nothing into gold
Death on such an ugly day
You dine like a king on top of the world

You show us all
That forgiveness is the weakest call
And now revenge
Against that grudge inside your tiny head
Remove the crown of absolution
Let the retribution fly
The king has all the king has all
But words can kill and maim and take their toll
And you massacre my dreams at night
And eat away at every thought
Until we take control
The king has all totalitarian and carnivore

Bow down submit to me and kiss the ground
Until it's safe to breathe and coexist again
Bow down submit to me and kiss the ground
Until it's safe to live and coexist again

They're taking away the freedom to be just you
They're taking away the freedom to be just you
They're taking away the freedom to be just you
They're taking away the freedom to be just you
But the sun always shines for you
They're taking away the freedom to be just you

You'd kill to find me
But the crown above my head is deadly

They're taking away the freedom to be just you
They're taking away the freedom to be just youfdcsfdcsAll my kingdom's gone
It's burned to the ground
Reason leaves me

As future sits upon a solitary throne
A treasure is sinking
Seems now long gone

The desert takes away
Our fears and dreams but they
Always will return

Be the moon and sun
Be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm
Read the writings in the stone

Be the moon and be the sun

Envisaging pictures of a dying dream
Fallen prison
The fa√ßade of wisdom in old scars

"Breathe deeper"
Don't lose the stars

My veins feel unshaken

In the skies a secret lies
Well disguised before my eyes

"The Universe is all around us kept in motion
Alleviate our pain and fear test our devotion"

Breathe in the pain
"Keep breathing"
You won't break these chains
"Keep digging"
For what you've foreseen

Was only a dream

Give me what's yours

Your kingdom is gone

It's burned to the ground

My fears and dreams but they
