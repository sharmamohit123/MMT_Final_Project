I got room
In my fumes (Yeah!)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit!)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)

She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone
I see some things that you might fear
"I'm doing a show, I be back soon" (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (No)
Now I got her in my room (Uh)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom
Hope we make it outta here
When I'm with you I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah!)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side

'Case it's fumes (Smoke)
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up!)
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit!)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)

We ain't stressing 'bout the loot
My block made that caser√≠o
This not the Molly this the boot
Ain't no coming back from here
Live the life of La Familia
It's so much gang that I can't see ya
Turn it up till they can't hear (They can't)
Running, running 'round for the thrill
Yeah, dog, dog 'round my real (Damn!)
Raw, raw, I've been pouring to the rim (Drank)
Naw, naw, naw, they not back of the VIP (In the VIP)
Gorgeous, baby keep me hard as steel
Ah, this my life I did not choose
Huh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
Uh, fill my mind up with ideas

'Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up!)
I'm the highest in the room (I'm the highest, it's lit!)
Hope I make it outta here (Outta here)

I'm the highest, you might got the Midas touch
The brightest and my bitch the vibiest
I'm excited, everything I do is exciting, now
Play with giants, little bit too extravagant
