fdcsThe more I try to catch your eye
The less I seem to hesitate
But every time you cross my mind
The words come out in figure 8's

I need to let go of everything
Ooh, it's getting hard to fight the feeling

She's your girl
She's in all your pictures
California girl, I wish I was her
When you're gone
She sleeps in your t-shirts
It hurts, I wish I was her
Ms. California
Ms. California

I love your voice but hate the way
You talk of her consistently
But every time you say her name
It honestly kills me
I need to let go of everything
Ooh, it's getting hard to fight the feeling

She's your girl
She's in all your pictures
California girl, I wish I was her
When you're gone
She sleeps in your t-shirts
It hurts, I wish I was her
Ms. California

And everything's better in California
And everything's better in California

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

When I've known this all along
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one that needs to know

I'll keep you my dirty little secret
(Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret

Who has to know
When we live such fragile lives
It's the best way we survive
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one that needs to know

I'll keep you my dirty little secret
(Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret

Who has to know
The way she feels inside (inside)
Those thoughts I can't deny (deny)
These sleeping thoughts won't lie (won't lie)
And all I've tried to hide
It's eating me apart
Trace this life out

I'll keep you my dirty little secret
(Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret)

I'll keep you my dirty little secret
(Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret

I poured him tea and he told me it'll all be okay
Well I told him I'd do anything to have him stay with me
So he laid me down, and I felt happy, come inside of me
He laid me down, and I felt happy

Oh if you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

I was in the bathroom, I didn't hear him leave
I locked the door behind him and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well I sighed and mumbled to myself again, I have to clean
I sighed and mumbled to myself

If you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
And if you're going, take the moon
Then maybe I will see you, in the night I'll see you
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more youfdcsfdcsWe're all living in Amerika.
