Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so...

Cold enough to chill my bones?
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, oh, when we're kissing, yeah
Feel so different, yeah.
Baby, tell me how did you get so...

Cold enough to chill my bones?
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me

Never thought that you were like this

I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space

Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of them
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system of catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Coldplay &amp; Beyoncé:]
You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then she tried to run
And then on the night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone

They warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping
It told her, don't you worry just

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again

Then she ran faster and
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me, come get me
Behind her, she can hear it say

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Then she ran faster and
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me
Just let me in, oohfdcs
