Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go shorty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck
It's not your birthday!

You find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look mami, I got the X, if you're into takin' drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

You find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look mami, I got the X, if you're into takin' drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck
But homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut hey nigga roll the weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells but I don't walk with a limp
In the hood, in L.A. they saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell you I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm fully focused man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend willing to get bi and they ready to go

You find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look mami, I got the X, if you're into takin' drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

You find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look mami, I got the X, if you're into takin' drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look nigga I done came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my joint get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking about money homie, I ain't concerned
I'mma tell you what Banks told me, "'Cause go 'head switch the style up
If niggas hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up."
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fucking be

You find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look mami, I got the X, if you're into takin' drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

You find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look mami, I got the X, if you're into takin' drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither nigga
We in the club all the time nigga
So pop pop off nigga
