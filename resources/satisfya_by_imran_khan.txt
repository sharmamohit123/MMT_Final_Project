Gaddi Lamborghini peele rang di
Menu kendi ay chala ve slowly
Oh pehle gear te oh, jadon mordi
O menu lagni ay the one and only

Ay ay bechare mundeyan de dilaan di tu qaatil
Vekhade meny kiven javengi tu faster
Dabb de tu gas ni a little bit harder
A bit harder yo

I'm a rider
Provider
Bring the heat girl
I will bring the fire
And my name keeps
Going worldwide now
So my job is to satisfy yaaa (aaa, ay, satisfy aaa, ai)

Call me call me Mr Makaveli
I make 'em disappear just like Harry Houdini
Ve ni me lyrically so insane ah
So I'm a chest te diamond diya Chainaa

Sanu na kise di vi cheez di problem
Kehnde lok they see me as a problem
Samaj na aave menu ki ay problem
I give them a cure with a fresh new album

I'm a rider

Bring the heat girl
I will bring the fire
And my name keeps going worldwide now
So my job is to satisfy yaaa (aaa, ay, satisfy aaa, ai)

Never gonna stop while I'm hard working
I am in a zone where you can't step in
Hit nahio Baneya ve straight to the bin
This is the way I like ta workin'

Never gonna stop while I'm hard working
I am in a zone where you can't step in
Hit nahio Baneya ve straight to the bin
So move out the way ay, ay, ay
