The day is coming like a pistol
That's aiming at my brain
The way you shining like a crystal
Makes me forget the pain

It's do or die, it's do or die
A battle cry, a battle cry

Don't stop keep going, don't stop keep going
Don't stop keep going, don't stop keep going

No limits, no limits
We're taking it all
We're taking it all
No limits, no limits
We're taking it all
We're taking it all
No limits

I've been walking tall lately
Nobody can hold me down
Things are moving like crazy
No, nothing can stop me now

I'm dreaming it, I'm dreaming it
I'm living big, I'm living big

Don't stop keep going, don't stop keep going
Don't stop keep going, don't stop keep going

No limits, no limits
We're taking it all
We're taking it all
No limits, no limits
We're taking it all
We're taking it all
No limits

No limits, no limits
Can't hold me back I'm all in it
No limits, no limits
No dream is too big not to finish

Don't stop keep going, don't stop keep going

No limits, no limits
We're taking it all
We're taking it all
No limits, no limits
We're taking it all
We're taking it all
No limits, no limits
We're taking it all
We're taking it all
No limits, no limits
We're taking it all
We're taking it all
No limits
