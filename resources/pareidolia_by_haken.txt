All my kingdom's gone
It's burned to the ground
Reason leaves me

As future sits upon a solitary throne
A treasure is sinking
Seems now long gone

The desert takes away
Our fears and dreams but they
Always will return

Be the moon and sun
Be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm
Read the writings in the stone

Be the moon and be the sun
Be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm
Read the writings in the stone

Seeking patterns
Envisaging pictures of a dying dream
Fallen prison
The fa√ßade of wisdom in old scars

Be the moon and sun
Be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm
Read the writings in the stone

Be the moon and be the sun
Be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm
Read the writings in the stone

Breathe in the air
"Breathe deeper"
Don't lose the stars
"Keep sinking"
The old spirit ware's
"Perceiving"
Speaking within
"Conceiving"

Show me the way
"Old spirits"
Uncertainty
"Deceiving"
Feelings arise
"Believing"
Take what is mine
"Retrieving"

Breathe in the air
"Breathe deeper"
Don't lose the stars
"Keep sinking"
The old spirit ware's
"Perceiving"
Speaking within
"Conceiving"

Show me the way
"Old spirits"
Uncertainty
"Deceiving"
Feelings arise
"Believing"
Take what is mine
"Retrieving"

As I've been forsaken
My veins feel unshaken

In the skies a secret lies
Well disguised before my eyes

"The Universe is all around us kept in motion
Alleviate our pain and fear test our devotion"

Breathe in the pain
"Keep breathing"
You won't break these chains
"Keep digging"
For what you've foreseen
"Believing"
Was only a dream
"Deceiving"

Give me what's yours
"Retrieving"
You've dug your own tomb
"Keep digging"
Your kingdom is gone
"Keep grieving"
It's burned to the ground
"defeated"

All my fears have drowned
All my fears have drowned
Seems now long gone

The ocean took away
My fears and dreams but they
Never returned

Be the moon and sun
Be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm
Read the writings in the stone

Be the moon and be the sun
Be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm
Read the writings in the stone

The universe is all around us
Read the writings in the stone
