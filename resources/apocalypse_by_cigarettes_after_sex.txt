You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust
Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
You’ve been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Your lips
My lips
Apocalypse
Your lips
My lips
Apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers flood is rising up on your knees
Oh please
Come out and haunt me
I know you want me
Come out and haunt me

Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist

Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Oh
When you're all alone
I will reach for you
When you're feeling low
I will be there too
