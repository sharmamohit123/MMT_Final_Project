(I'm a wavewalker, wavewalker)

How's it so simple? Faith like a child
I give You an inch and You take me a mile
I feel the wind rush and the thunder roll
Two feet on the water, only one way to go, yeah

I don't gotta be afraid no more, no
'Cause I know You'll walk me through the storm
I'm more then just a talker
I'm a, I'm a
I'm a, I'm a

I'm a wavewalker
I'm dancin' on water (Whoa)
When the devil tries to shake me
I just pray harder
Even in my darkest hour
Got Holy Ghost power
When I keep my eyes upon You, Jesus
I'm a wavewalker (Wavewalker)

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
I'm a wavewalker, wavewalker

I walk over my fears, over my doubt (Yeah)
The supernatural it feels so natural now

I don't gotta be afraid no more, yeah
'Cause I know You walk me through the storm
I'm more then just a talker
I'm a wavewalker

I'm a wavewalker
I'm dancin' on water (Whoa)
When the devil tries to shake me
I just pray harder
Even in my darkest hour
Got Holy Ghost power
When I keep my eyes upon You, Jesus
I'm a wavewalker, wavewalker

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't you hear me now?
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
When I keep my eyes upon You, Jesus
I'm a wavewalker, wavewalker
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Gonna keep my eyes on you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
When I keep my eyes upon You, Jesus
I'm a wavewalker, wavewalker

You will make a way
Gonna make, gonna make a way
When it feels like there's no way
Feels like there's no way
So I will walk by faith
Gonna walk, gonna walk by faith
'Cause You will make a way
You will make a way

And you will make a way
Oh, you're gonna make a way
When it feels like there's no way
Feels like there's no way
So I will walk by faith
I'm gonna walk by faith
'Cause You will make a way
You will make a way

I'm a wavewalker
I'm dancin' on water

Even in my darkest hour
Got Holy Ghost power (Holy Ghost power)
When I keep my eyes upon You, Jesus
