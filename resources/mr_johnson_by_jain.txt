Mr Johnson must get out
Mr Johnson must be free
Mr Johnson must get wild
Before the night
[x2]

Everyday he dreams to walk
Away from these office doors
Everyday he dreams for more
He dreams for a change to come

It's hard to find a way
In the middle of a crowd
It's always hard to say
If our doubts are wrong or right

Mr Johnson must get out
Mr Johnson must be free
Mr Johnson must get wild
Before the night
[x2]

Everyday he feels the same
Feels the same, a little pain
When he looks up in the sky
When his dreams are flying far

That's how he realizes
He has to make a change
He won't let any man now
Across his rights to life

Mr Johnson must get out
Mr Johnson must be free
Mr Johnson must get wild
Before the night
[x2]

He runs to get out
He rushes to get out
He wanna feel the sun warming his mind
He'd better watch out, not gonna burn
Up finding his way, flying away
[x2]

Mr Johnson must get out
Mr Johnson must be free
Mr Johnson must get wild
Before the night
[x4]
