It might be impractical
To seek out a new romance
We won't know the actual
If we never take the chance
I'd love to collapse with you 
And ease you against this song
I think we're compatible 
I see that you think I'm wrong

But anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you

Your love makes a fool of you 
You can't seem to understand
Our heart doesn't play by rules
And love has it's own demands
But I'll be there to take care of you 
If ever you should decide
But you don't want to waste your life
In the middle of a lovesick lullaby

Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you

Oh my reddest rose, caldera, set it off
How your fire grows hermosa caldera glistening 
Through your fussed blows careen your caldera set it off
As your body flows the second hand flashes passes
Over your skin like time

Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
My love
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do 
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you
