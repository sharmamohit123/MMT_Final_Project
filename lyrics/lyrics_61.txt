fdcsCome up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start

Oh
Oh
Oh
OhfdcsFeeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[2x]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans

Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

[2x]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)fdcsTell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
I will comfort you for sure

If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are, I'll run to your front door
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Love, between our love
Love, between our love

Shadows play on idle hands
I lose myself, I do
But I find my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you

If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where we are, you're still the one I choose
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave (in a wave)
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Love, between our love
Love, between our love

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apartfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcs
