You're the one 'til my tan fades away
Get on a train and we'll be strangers again
You're the one 'til my tan fades away
Get on a train and we'll be strangers again
We'll be strangers again
We'll be strangers again
We'll be strangers again
We'll be strangers again
We'll be strangers again...

You're the one 'til my tan fades away
Get on a train and we'll be strangers again
You're the one 'til my tan fades away
Get on a train and we'll be strangers again
We'll be strangers again
We'll be strangers again
We'll be strangers again
We'll be strangers again
We'll be strangers again...

You're the one 'til my tan fades away
Get on a train and we'll be strangers again
You're the one 'til my tan fades away
Get on a train and we'll be strangers again
