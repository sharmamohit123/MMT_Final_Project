fdcsLately I'm counting the minutes that I've got left
And lately I'm counting the words that I haven't said
'Cause you will never know what I been through
And you should be a little more gentle
But maybe I need to start taking my own advice
'Cause my heart's so heavy it's ready to fall out twice
'Cause you will never know what I been through
So you should be a little more gentle with me

My skin is made of glass
But apparently it's stained
'Cause you notice all the cracks
But can't look inside my pain
And if you throw another stone
Then I'd stay far away, far away
I just might break

My life's just a faded memory of one I can't have
And everything round me is starting to fade into black
But black and white is so much better
I'm learning how to hide my colours
You shoulda been a little more gentle with me

My skin is made of glass
But apparently it's stained
'Cause you notice all the cracks
But can't look inside my pain
And if you throw another stone
Then I'd stay far away, far away
I just might break, break
Break, I
I might break
Might break

My skin is made of glass
But apparently it's stained
'Cause you notice all the cracks
But can't look inside my pain
And if you throw another stone
Then I'd stay far away, far away
I just might breakfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcs
