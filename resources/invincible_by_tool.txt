Long in tooth and soul
Longing for another win
Lurch into the fray
Weapon out and belly in

Warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Bellow aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am

Beating chest and drums
Beating tired bones again
Age-old battle, mine
Weapon out and belly in

Tales told
Of battles won
Of things we've done
Caligula would grin

Beating tired bones
Tripping through, remember when
Once invincible
Now the armor's wearing thin
Heavy shield down

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Relevant

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Cry aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am
Where I am

Warrior
Struggling
To remain
Relevant

A warrior
Struggling
To remain
Consequential

Tears in my eyes, chasing Ponce de León's phantoms
So filled with hope, I can taste mythical fountains
False hope, perhaps, but the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting, feeling time, bearing down
