We are spirit
Bound to this flesh
We go around one foot nailed down
We're bound to reach out and beyond
This flesh become Pneuma

We are will and wonder
Bound to recall, remember
(We are born of)
One breath, one word
(We are all)
One spark, sun becoming

Child, wake up
Child, release
The light
Wake up now, child, wake up
Child, release
The light
Wake up now, child

(Spirit)
(Spirit)
(Spirit)
(Spirit)

Bound to this flesh
This guise, this mask, this dream
Wake up, remember
(We are born of)
One breath, one word
(We are all)
One spark, sun becoming

Pneuma
Reach out and beyond
Wake up, remember
(We are born of)
One breath, one word
(We are all)
One spark, eyes full of wonder
