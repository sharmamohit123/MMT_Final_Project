The future's blurry but the past is a trap
I might be staring at my last chance

But I'm cold blooded
I'm cold blooded
Ice in my veins
Never gonna run
Venom on my fangs
Fire on my tongue

I'm cold blooded
It's all or nothing
If I go down
Gonna burn with the sun
Won't quit now
Till I'm sitting on the throne

Digging in the dirt for a reason yeah
Face the fear, face the demons yeah
No this ain't pre-season
We gotta rise up, gonna die before we beaten yeah

Stand tall with my legion yeah
Hear the name that they screaming yeah
Chasing power but I ain't evil yeah
Life of the party, remember me as the dreamer yeah

I don't ever ever wanna look back
The future's blurry but the past is a trap
I might be staring at my last chance

But I'm cold blooded
I'm cold blooded
Ice in my veins
Never gonna run
Venom on my fangs
Fire on my tongue

I'm cold blooded
It's all or nothing
If I go down
Gonna burn with the sun

Till I'm sitting on the throne
I'm cold blooded

I don't ever ever wanna look back
The future's blurry but the past is a trap
I might be staring at my last chance
