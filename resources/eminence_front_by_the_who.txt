The sun shines
And people forget
The spray flies as the speedboat glides
And people forget
Forget they're hiding
The girls smile
And people forget
The snow packs as the skier tracks
And people forget
Forget they're hiding

Behind an eminence front
Eminence front - It's a put on
It's an Eminence front
It's an Eminence front - It's a put on
An Eminence front
Eminence front - It's a put on
Eminence front
It's an Eminence front
It's an Eminence front - It's a put on
It's a put on
It's a put on
It's a put on

Come and join the party
Dress to kill
Won't you come and join the party
Dress to kill
Dress to kill

The drinks flow
People forget
That big wheel spins, the hair thins
People forget
Forget they're hiding
The news slows
People forget
The shares crash, hopes are dashed
People forget
Forget they're hiding

Behind an eminence front
An Eminence front - it's a put on
It's just an Eminence front
An Eminence front - It's a put on
An Eminence front
An Eminence front- It's a put on
Eminence front
It's an Eminence front - It's a put on

It's a put on
It's a put on
It's a put on

Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to kill
Dress yourself to kill
