Shadow, see how far I go
(Step by step I'll keep it up, I won't slow, I gotta go)
Through the embers, through the rows
(Every shadow step I take, I'll make sure that I won't break)
Show them all just what I know
(While the years they come and go, I won't let myself get slow)
'Cause they all just come and go
(Every step that I will take, I'll make sure that I won't break)

Oh, if I fall down, fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
Oh, if I fall down, fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running

And if it hurts don't let it show
(Step by step I'll keep it up, I won't slow, I gotta go)
While the seasons come and go
(Every shadow step I take, I'll make sure that I won't break)
Shadow chiaroscuro
(While the years they come and go, I won't let myself get slow)
When I, when I fall down, fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
Oh, when I fall down, fall down
Won't you know to keep me running

Yeah, I keep on running
Well, I keep on running

Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer, so I'll go on further
Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer, so I'll go on further
Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer, so I'll go on further
Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer, so I'll go on further

Oh, when I fall down, fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
Oh, if I fall down, fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running

Fall down, when I slow down (Keep on running)
Slow down (Keep on running)
Ohh, slow down (Keep on running)
(Keep on running)
(Keep on running)
(Keep on running)
(Keep on running)
