fdcsAnd I, I tend to be my own worst enemy
And I, I linger on everything
But I find when I'm alone it gets so hard to breathe
And I, I, and I
Shouldn't apologize for just existing
Shouldn't apologize for just being me
Trying to hide behind all my distractions
Ok 'til quiet comes
When it all dies down it gets so loud
All the voices in my head just try to fill me up with doubt
I'm learning how to turn around
All the voices in my head
I think I've found my favorite sound
I think I've found my favorite sound
Oh, I think I've found my favorite sound
Do you take the time to recognize yourself?
Do you spin like a carousel?
I want you to know that it's okay to ask for help
We all need help
We all need help
Shouldn't apologize for just existing
Shouldn't apologize for just being me
Trying to hide behind all my distractions
Ok when the quiet comes
When it all dies down it gets so loud
All the voices in my head just try to fill me up with doubt
I'm learning how to turn around
All the voices in my head
I think I've found my favorite sound
I think I've found my favorite sound
Oh, I think I've found my favorite sound
I think I've found my favorite sound
Oh, I think I've found my favorite sound
Embrace the silence
Trying to find this feeling that I'm doing okay
I'm my own project, a work in progress
I know I'm better than okay
