The night sky once ruled my imagination.
Now I turn the dials with careful calculation.
After a while, I thought I’d never find you.
I convinced myself that I would never find you,
When suddenly I saw you.

At first I thought you were a constellation.
I made a map of your stars, then I had a revelation:
You’re as beautiful as endless,
You’re the universe I’m helpless in.
An astronomer at my best
When I throw away the measurements.

Like a telescope,
I will pull you so close
'til no space lies in between.

And suddenly I see you.
Suddenly I see you.

I was a billion little pieces
'til you pulled me into focus.
Astronomy in reverse,
It was me who was discovered.

(I thought I’d never find you,
When suddenly I saw you.)

Like a telescope,
I will pull you so close,
'til no space lies in between.

Then suddenly I see you.
