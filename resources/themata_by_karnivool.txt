Step in this room where I wanna be
Surely you mean this something
You're bringing me down to a silent breath
when it's the truth that I wanna see

Search myself for the reason
The ever loving greed
I am put off slighty
So what am I to see.. oh my love 
In the sensory serenity

So pull the pin inside
Baby let it ride
Never knowin' I'm the next to see
With the fire sign
Never make it mine
Never knowin' I'm the next to be

I am learning slowly
So what am I to see
Every twist and turning
Through my hypocrisy

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world is a lie

Like a knot it binds, suffocating minds
Never knowing, I'm in the next to see
With the fire sign
Never make it mine
Never knowin' I'm the next to bleed

I am learning slowly
So what am I to see
Every twist and turning
Through my hypocrisy
Search myself for the reason
Forever loving greed
I am bored of silence
So what am I to see?

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world is a lie

Lie awake, still, as I try to breathe
Surely you mean this is something
You're bringing me down to a silent breath
and it's the truth that I wanna see

In the sensory, serenity
could it be, that I'm the next to see?
In the sensory, serenity
could it be, that I'm the next to see?
In the sensory, serenity
could it be, that I'm the next to see?
In the sensory, serenity
could it be, that I'm in ecstasy 

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world isn't mine

It's So good to see
This world I'm in loves me..
So
