Tell me what you gon' do
You holding, onto nothing
Acting like you hate me
You resent me, for something
I'm sick of all the wrong, words
Like "I hate you"
I'm sick of all the songs that, I can always relate to

Let's try another night
You're drunk I wanna die
Let's try another night
Cause I'm getting kind of sick of everything that's in my life

I'm sick of it all, sick of it all
Sick of it all, sick of it all
Sick of it all
I'm getting kind of sick of everything that's in my life
I'm sick of my girl, sick of my thoughts
I'm sick of my crib, I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of this love, that got me fucked up
I'm sick of it all, I'm sick of it all (I'm sick of it all)

I'll tell you what I won't do
Is text you back and give you the advantage that you want
That validation keeps you coming back
I'm sick of all the fucking trash on Instagram
The ass is fat on every girl in LuLu Lemon
Yoga pants no yoga mat
And all, I want
Is someone really there, baby
Sick of all the songs, reminding me
That I'm really still all alone

Let's try another night
You're drunk I wanna die
Let's try another night
Cause I'm getting kind of sick of everything that's in my life

I'm sick of it all, sick of it all
Sick of it all, sick of it all
Sick of it all
I'm getting kind of sick of everything that's in my life
I'm sick of my girl, sick of my thoughts
I'm sick of my crib, I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of this love, that got me fucked up
I'm sick of it all, I'm sick of it all
Sick of it all, Sick of it all
Sick of it all, Sick of it all
I'm getting kind of sick of everything that's in my life
I'm sick of my girl, sick of my thoughts
I'm sick of my crib, I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of this love, that got me fucked up
I'm sick of it all, I'm sick of it all (I'm sick of it all)
