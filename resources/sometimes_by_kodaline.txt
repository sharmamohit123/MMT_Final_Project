I'm not looking for an answer, I just hope these words will help
Whoever's listening, if someone cares to listen in
I've been up and down in life, sure, every day's a chance to fight
Forever wrestling, trying to make amends again

But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go
It's hitting me hard but I'm lucky I know

All of my friends
Don't understand
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm blind
Maybe we all get lost sometimes
Sometimes

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)

And every night when I'm alone I put another podcast on
It helps me slip away, keeps me learning everyday
Reading books on meditation fights away the hesitations
Hanging over me, easing the anxiety

But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go
It's hitting me hard but I'm lucky I know

All of my friends
Don't understand
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm blind
Maybe we all get lost sometimes
Sometimes

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe we all get lost sometimes (Oh, oh, oh)

But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
'Cause I'm lucky I know
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go
It's hitting me hard but I'm taking it slow

All of my friends
Don't understand
Maybe I'm crazy
Going outta my mind
Maybe we all get lost sometimes
Sometimes

(Oh, oh, oh)
But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
(Oh, oh, oh)
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
'Cause I'm lucky I know
(Oh, oh, oh)
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go
(Oh, oh, oh)
It's hitting me hard but I'm taking it slow
All get lost sometimes
