Is my love too much,
Or is it just enough,
For you, for you?
'Cause it's getting late
Would you like to stay? Ha-ah
'Cause I'm bad at reading signs
But I...

I wanna do
Whatever you wanna do
If you want it too
Girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind

Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
'Cause feelings are hard to find
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
'Cause feelings are hard

But I feel 'em in my chest
A tiny war within
But when I pull you closer
Girl, I can't explain
But I...

I wanna do
Whatever you wanna do
If you want it too
Girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind

Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
'Cause feelings are hard to find
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
'Cause feelings are hard, yeah

And I know, and I know
That it hurts sometimes
That it hurts sometimes
When I'm with you
And I know, and I know
That it hurts sometimes
That it hurts sometimes
When I miss you
And I know, and I know
That it's on your mind
That it's on your mind
When I kiss you
But...
I wanna do
Whatever you wanna do

I wanna do
Whatever you wanna do
If you want it too
Girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind

Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
'Cause feelings are hard to find
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Feelings are hard to find, yeah
