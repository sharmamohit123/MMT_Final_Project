How did they find me?
How did they know?
This misconception of fate
I'm about to let go

Awake in a new light, I'm
Alone in this room
Heavy at heart, it may be a lie
You will not see me

It's a new day
(Why did they follow me home?)
It's a new day

One
More
Step, it's
Here waiting for you, now
Go
Slow, take your time

Leave
No
Mark
You lost your way
I hope you're watching me

One
More
Step, it's
Here waiting for you, now
Go
Slow, take your time

Celebrating
For the one so free
You lost your way
No-one held you back from me

How do you all
Speak
With a lying tongue?
How do we all
Sleep
With a dying sun?

Sit down
Lighten your own
This storm is coming
You should stay home
But I feel warm

Hey, let's get lost in the crowd, while
Searching for something worth holding
Hey, let's get still lost in the crowd
I'll show you so much more
Much more
So much more
So much more

Are we waiting?
For the savior?
Someone to heal this
Or erase us

How did they find me?
How did they know?
This misconception of fate
I'm about to let go

Awake in a new light, I'm
Alone in this room
Heavy at heart, it may be a lie
You will not see me

It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day

Are we waiting?
For the savior?
I'm so sick of waiting
I've been waiting my whole life

This is a new day
This is a new day
This is a new day
