fdcsfdcsHeal myself-a feather on my heart
Look inside-there never was a start
Peel myself-dispose of severed skin
All subsides-around me and within

There's nothing painful in this
There's no upheaval
Redemption for my pathos
All sins undone

Awaiting word on what's to come
In helpless prayers a hope lives on
As I've come clean I've forgotten what I promised
In the rays of the sun I am longing for the darknessfdcsStep in this room where I wanna be
Surely you mean this something
You're bringing me down to a silent breath
when it's the truth that I wanna see

Search myself for the reason
The ever loving greed
I am put off slighty
So what am I to see.. oh my love 
In the sensory serenity

So pull the pin inside
Baby let it ride
Never knowin' I'm the next to see
With the fire sign
Never make it mine
Never knowin' I'm the next to be

I am learning slowly
So what am I to see
Every twist and turning
Through my hypocrisy

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world is a lie

Like a knot it binds, suffocating minds
Never knowing, I'm in the next to see
With the fire sign
Never make it mine
Never knowin' I'm the next to bleed

I am learning slowly
So what am I to see
Every twist and turning
Through my hypocrisy
Search myself for the reason
Forever loving greed
I am bored of silence
So what am I to see?

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world is a lie

Lie awake, still, as I try to breathe
Surely you mean this is something
You're bringing me down to a silent breath
and it's the truth that I wanna see

In the sensory, serenity
could it be, that I'm the next to see?
In the sensory, serenity
could it be, that I'm the next to see?
In the sensory, serenity
could it be, that I'm the next to see?
In the sensory, serenity
could it be, that I'm in ecstasy 

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world isn't mine

It's So good to see
This world I'm in loves me..
SofdcsHow did they find me?
How did they know?
This misconception of fate
I'm about to let go

Awake in a new light, I'm
Alone in this room
Heavy at heart, it may be a lie
You will not see me

It's a new day
(Why did they follow me home?)
It's a new day

One
More
Step, it's
Here waiting for you, now
Go
Slow, take your time

Leave
No
Mark
You lost your way
I hope you're watching me

One
More
Step, it's
Here waiting for you, now
Go
Slow, take your time

Celebrating
For the one so free
You lost your way
No-one held you back from me

How do you all
Speak
With a lying tongue?
How do we all
Sleep
With a dying sun?

Sit down
Lighten your own
This storm is coming
You should stay home
But I feel warm

Hey, let's get lost in the crowd, while
Searching for something worth holding
Hey, let's get still lost in the crowd
I'll show you so much more
Much more
So much more
So much more

Are we waiting?
For the savior?
Someone to heal this
Or erase us

How did they find me?
How did they know?
This misconception of fate
I'm about to let go

Awake in a new light, I'm
Alone in this room
Heavy at heart, it may be a lie
You will not see me

It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day

Are we waiting?
For the savior?
I'm so sick of waiting
I've been waiting my whole life

This is a new day
This is a new day
This is a new dayfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcs
