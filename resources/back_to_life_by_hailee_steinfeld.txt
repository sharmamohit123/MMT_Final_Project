'Cause I'm bringin' you back to life

Our love's enough
Transcending us through space and time
It's holdin' up
It keeps you and me intertwined

What's a pipe dream if you ain't tryin' to do it?
What's a heartbreak if you ain't cryin' through it?
What's a sunset if you ain't ridin' into it?
Let's drive into it

'Cause I'm bringin' you back to life
And I know that you're gone but I swear that you're here
It's a feelin' that won't disappear
And you're bringin' me back to life
I was lookin' for somethin' that I couldn't find
It's a feelin' you give me inside

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I'm bringin' you back to life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This feeling's comin' back to life

Our memories
They're more than just our history (Our history)
They lift me up
They flow like electricity (Oh-oh, oh)

What's a pipe dream if you ain't tryin' to do it?
What's a heartbreak if you ain't cryin' through it?
What's a sunset if you ain't ridin' into it?
Let's drive into it

'Cause I'm bringin' you back to life
And I know that you're gone but I swear that you're here
It's a feelin' that won't disappear
And you're bringin' me back to life
I was lookin' for somethin' that I couldn't find
It's a feelin' you give me inside

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I'm bringin' you back to life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This feeling's comin' back to life

I can see you in the night
Comin' through like flashin' lights
When the world is passin' by
Oh, oh, oh
I can see you in the night
Comin' through like flashin' lights
When the world is passin' by
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause I'm bringin' you back to life
And I know that you're gone but I swear that you're here
It's a feelin' that won't disappear
And you're bringin' me back to life
I was lookin' for somethin' that I couldn't find
It's a feelin' you give me inside

'Cause I'm bringin' you back
'Cause I'm bringin' you back
'Cause I'm bringin' you back to life
'Cause I'm bringin' you back to life
And you're bringin' me back
And you're bringin' me back
And you're bringin' me back to life
This feeling's comin' back to life

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I'm bringin' you back to life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This feeling's comin' back to life
