fdcsWell, I will call you darlin' and everything will be okay
'Cause I know that I am yours and you are mine
Doesn't matter anyway
In the night, we'll take a walk, it's nothin' funny
Just to talk

Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine

Well, I have called you darlin' and I'll say it again, again
So kiss me 'til I'm sorry, babe, that you are gone and I'm a mess
And I'll hurt you and you'll hurt me and we'll say things we can't repeat

Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine

You need to know
We'll take it slow
I miss you so
We'll take it slow
It's hard to feel you slipping (You need to know)
Through my fingers are so numb (We'll take it slow)
And how was I supposed to know (I miss you so)
That you were not the one?

Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
Oh darlin', darlin', baby, you're so very fine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you-

Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Yeah...
I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hoping you'll find someone else
Cause yeah, we still young there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it off this bed
I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings

It'll get you up and going out of bed

I'm happy that you're here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos while walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sang me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays went to church, on Mondays watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

And I, don't stay awake for too long

Of one another, be honest
What's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like where you been
Love me like you don't want it to end

In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna befdcsfdcsfdcs
