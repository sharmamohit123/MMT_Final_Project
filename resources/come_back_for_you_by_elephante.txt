It's coming back just like a replay
Rolling down the freeway, honey
The thought of you brings me to tears
It's been so many years
I'm finally seein' clear now, honey

Ooooh
I remember you and I were free then
But I was leavin'
Ooooh
You and I were caught up in a feeling
And I still believe it

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I would be the one to make you feel this way
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I give all I have for you
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I would be the one to take away your pain
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
Baby I come back for you

Baby I come back for you
Baby I come back for you

Doesn't matter where I'm goin'
'Long as it's you I'm holdin' honey
You are the only one who knows me
The one who can expose me
Sometimes I think it shows me, and it's like

Ooooh
I remember you and I were free then
But I was leavin'
Ooooh
You and I were caught up in a feeling
And I still believe it

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I would be the one to make you feel this way
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I give all I have for you
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I would be the one to take away your pain
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
Baby I come back for you

Baby I come back for
Baby I come back for you
(Didn't I, didn't I)
(Didn't I, didn't I)
(Didn't I, didn't I)
(Didn't I, didn't I)

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I would be the one to make you feel this way
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I give all I have for you
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I would be the one to take away your pain
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
Baby I come back for you

Oooh, baby I come back for you
Yeah, baby I come back for you

Baby I come back for you
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I would be the one to take away your pain
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
Baby I come back for you
