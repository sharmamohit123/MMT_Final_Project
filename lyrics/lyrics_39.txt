Let's light it up let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright
We'll find a way
We'll find a way to keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Onto the wild side
The hunger satisfied

We're burnin' up

We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

[Sam Martin:]
We'll never know
We'll never know what stands behind the door
But I got a feeling and it's a feeling
That it's worth dying for
Just close your eyes and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving
'Til we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride

We're burnin' up

We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

Let's light it up let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so brightfdcsfdcsfdcsfdcsFound you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

I said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me

I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

You don't have to say just what you did (what you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (oh-woah)

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there

Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)fdcsYou are my water, my sun, my moon and stars
Your heart is all I need
It start when you come
I want to be where you are, where you are (na, na)

Every time you go away, you're always tryna fight
How bad I want you, bad I want you
I could try to fill the space with someone else tonight
But I don't want to (I don't want to), I don't want to

Right now, you know I miss your body
So I won't kiss nobody until you come back home
And I swear, the next time that I hold you
I won't let you go nowhere
You'll never be alone, I'll never let you go

You lead, I follow, no sleep
That's what you said (that's what you said)
That's what you said (that's what you said)
And you should know
You leave, I'm hollow
I need you in my bed (I need you in my)
You in my bed (I need you in my)

I'm sorry but
Don't wanna talk
I need a moment before I go
It's nothing personal

I draw the blinds
They don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand
They don't understand

So then when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business
And ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery
Make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl

So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way

[Farruko:]
(Ya, ya)
(Farru, yeah, guaya)
Lo siento mucho (Farru), pero me voy (Eh)
Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy (Eh-ey)
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errore', también soy humano
Y tú no ve' que lo hago porque te amo (Pum-pum-pum-pum)

Pero ya (Ya) no tengo más na' que hacer aquí (Aquí)
Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir (Partir)
De mi propio camino, seguir lejos de ti
