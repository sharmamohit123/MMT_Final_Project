Rolling down the freeway, honey
The thought of you brings me to tears
It's been so many years
I'm finally seein' clear now, honey

Ooooh
I remember you and I were free then
But I was leavin'
Ooooh
You and I were caught up in a feeling
And I still believe it

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I would be the one to make you feel this way
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I give all I have for you
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
I would be the one to take away your pain
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I say
Baby I come back for you

Baby I come back for you
Baby I come back for you

Doesn't matter where I'm goin'
'Long as it's you I'm holdin' honey
You are the only one who knows me
The one who can expose me
Sometimes I think it shows me, and it's like

Ooooh

This ain't sitting real good in my soul

All my life I wanted me an Indian (There She Go)
Now she's far away

In the street
With a wedding ring
And she hit the bar
City babe, are you down to cheat
He looked in her eye
Chivalry is it really dead?
He pulled out a tip? Pay Up
Jumpin' right on him
Thinkin' when's it good to intervene
Then I lost her
Lost her to the world and the girls and impostors
Entertain? I doubt it'll pay and it cost her
I ain't mad at me but it hurts

I thought she was an Indian (Navajo)
Now she only worried bout' the Benjamin's (Grab The Gold)
She Been lurking' in my dreams (There she go)

40 answers to the questions she's asking of me
What you doing later on?
I got nowhere to be
No, no, no

Is my crew on?
What you on?
We been uptown cruising in the Yukon
Got a couple girls on my living futon
And they about to wake so better get a move on
Better get some food on
Cause when I'm hungry I'm a prick
I ate a Snickers but a Snick ain't doing shit
Argue over sushi or Italian for a bit
I say sake bombs
This something we agree upon
Later on we'll go on to the bar
Hand full of cash and a brain full of stars
I'm more thrown than a food fight
Feeling too right
Margarita by the pool side
Wow, this is all I ever wanted in life
Yeah, this is all I ever wanted tonight
And we said

40 ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds
40 answers to the questions she's asking of me
What you doing later on?
I got nowhere to be
No, no, no

And we've been roaming for a while, coast to coast
The bamboo 45, kicking up rocks
Kicking out dust on the roads of us
When we was very little
Malcolm in the Middle
I fly by in that all white coupe
Looking so clean in that all white suit
And them pretty black girls with them afro roots
Long legs, big hair, and them tie dye hoops
Later on move along to The Ville
In a warm summer home where the broads wanna chill
Thinking waves and I'm thinking sun
Thinking limes and I'm thinking rum
Thinking maybe you and I move away from the crowd
Got a little room in the back of the house
And everything's cool
Girl, we go together like water in a pool
And we said

40 ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds
40 answers to the questions she's asking of me
What you doing later on?
I got nowhere to be
No, no, no

Near the ocean
Near the water
Only good things
No piranha
All the good days of the views I love ain't never been so clear

Times like these, you just take it slow
Fall asleep in the pillows

And there she goes
Heart that pounds like a stereo
You take me round and round like the merry-go
But one more ride, baby, here we go

You holding, onto nothing
Acting like you hate me
You resent me, for something
I'm sick of all the wrong, words
Like "I hate you"
I'm sick of all the songs that, I can always relate to

Let's try another night
You're drunk I wanna die
Let's try another night
Cause I'm getting kind of sick of everything that's in my life

I'm sick of it all, sick of it all
Sick of it all, sick of it all
Sick of it all
I'm getting kind of sick of everything that's in my life
I'm sick of my girl, sick of my thoughts
I'm sick of my crib, I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of this love, that got me fucked up
I'm sick of it all, I'm sick of it all (I'm sick of it all)

I'll tell you what I won't do
Is text you back and give you the advantage that you want
That validation keeps you coming back
I'm sick of all the fucking trash on Instagram
The ass is fat on every girl in LuLu Lemon
Yoga pants no yoga mat
And all, I want
Is someone really there, baby
Sick of all the songs, reminding me
That I'm really still all alone

Let's try another night
You're drunk I wanna die
Let's try another night
Cause I'm getting kind of sick of everything that's in my life
