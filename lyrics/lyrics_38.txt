I'm happy that you're here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos while walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sang me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays went to church, on Mondays watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

Like a song
And did you ever notice 
The way light means more than it did all day long?

Words mean more at night
Light means more
Like your hair and your face and your smile
And our bed and the dress that you wore

So I’ll send you my words
From the corners of my room
And though I write them by the light of day
Please read them by the light of the moon

And I wish I could leave my bones and my skin
And float over the tired tired sea
So that I could see you again

Maybe you would leave too
And we’d blindly pass each other
Floating over the ocean blue
Just to find the warm bed of our lover

And I’ll send you my words
From the corners of my room
And though I write them by the light of day
Please read them by the light of the moonfdcsI just pretend that I'm in the dark

City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack.
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see.
You won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free.

You've got a new horizon. It's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've gotta kiss me
'Cause I don't get to sleep, no.
